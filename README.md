# Discord Music Bot

2024 Note: Bot requires stable connection to YouTube (use [Goodbye dpi](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI/releases/tag/0.2.3rc3) for example)

Since a lot of bots were banned by YouTube, here is custom self-hosted implementation  
To run the bot you need:
+ Create discord bot and copy token to .env file (example of .env is given)
+ Get your Guild_id, which is ID of a server, bot will be on
+ Download ffmpeg and add to PATH
+ Run main.py (or run.ps1 script)
